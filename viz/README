viz is a replacement for:
GRAPH=1
JITGRAPH=1
GRAPHUOPS=1

and a viewer for:
SAVE_SCHEDULE=1
TRACK_MATCH_STATS=2

to use:
1. Run tinygrad with VIZ=1 (this saves the pkls and launches the server)
2. That's it!

This should be able to:
1. See all schedules
2. See all graphs and how they were rewritten
3. See generated code
